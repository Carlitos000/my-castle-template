            <h2>Slane Castle</h2>
            <p>
                This fortress is situated in the heart of the Boyne Valley and dates back to the 1700s. It was Albert Conyngham and his son Major General Henry Conyngham who bought the land where Slane Castle and Slane Distillery is located. His family and descendants were known as the ones who worked on planning and improving the Village of Slane in 1781.
In 1785, the castle was built by the Conynghams, who was originally from Scotland. The construction was under the supervision of William Burton Conyngham, who employed the collective talents of some of Ireland and Englandâ€™s most prestigious names in architecture.  The Castle is one of the most exciting historic buildings in Ireland, with its stunning Gothic and Gothic Revival architectural style. Its surrounding parklands, meanwhile, were designed by a renowned landscape architect, Capability Brown. Today, the castle is owned by Henry Conyngham, who transformed the castle grounds into a premier concert venue in the 1980s. A fire in 1991 caused extensive damage to the castle, particularly the part that faced the River Boyne. It was closed to the public for a decade so it can undergo reconstructions and was reopened in 2001. Today, the castle and the estate remains to be a top attraction in the area, as well as a venue for concerts, weddings, and other events.
